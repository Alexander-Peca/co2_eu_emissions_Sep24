a) Project Purpose and Goals: This project focuses on using machine learning to
help the automotive industry meet the EU's 2035 target of 0 g CO₂/km for passenger
cars and vans. By analyzing extensive vehicle data, machine learning models can
identify factors influencing CO₂ emissions, aiding manufacturers in designi
low-emission vehicles. This ensures compliance with regulations, reduces penalties,
and enhances brand reputation. The project also aims to optimize production
strategies by enabling early design adjustments, especially as the industry shifts
towards zero-emission vehicles and considers alternative energy sources like
hydrogen or electricity for appliances in motorhomes (as a collateral effect).
b) Technical Goals include preprocessing data, selecting features, training models,
and evaluating results. Real-time tools will be developed to predict CO₂ emissions in
new designs. The project will also explore how innovative technologies for CO₂
reduction might be applied across different industries.
c) Economic Benefits involve avoiding penalties, cutting redesign costs, enabli
competitive pricing, accessing government incentives, and boosting marketing
through eco-friendly recognition.
d) Scientific Contribution includes identifying emission-related data patterns a
supporting sustainable vehicle tech development, while acknowledging the project’s
limited scope: focusing only on CO₂ emissions during vehicle operation, not the
entire product lifecycle. The main objectives are to find correlations between vehic
features and CO₂ emissions and to accurately predict emissions based on technical
characteristics.
The primary dataset for this project is the EU (EEA) dataset, named “CO2 emissions
from new passenger cars”, provided by the European Environment Agency. It
contains CO₂ emission data for newly registered cars across 30 countries from 2010 to
2023. This dataset is substantial, initially over 16 GB, but was reduced through data
transformation and consolidation.
